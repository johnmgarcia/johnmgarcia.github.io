# Masterplan for Johnmatthew's Resume Website

## App Overview and Objectives

This is a simple, responsive personal website for Johnmatthew. Its primary goal is to serve as an online resume, providing a clear and concise overview of academic and professional credentials.

## Target Audience

* Potential employers or collaborators
* Academic institutions
* Professional network connections

## Core Features and Functionality

* Intro section with a headline
* Short biography

* **Platform**: Hosted on Replit
* **Responsive Design**: Mobile and desktop compatibility via media queries or a CSS framework

## Conceptual Data Model

No database needed. All content will be static for now. Placeholder sections to be manually updated:

* Bio Text
* Education Items
* Work Experience Items
* Social Media URLs

## User Interface Design Principles

* Clean, simple layout
* Mobile-first responsive design
* Clear hierarchy with section headers
* Easy navigation (one-page scroll or simple menu)

## Security Considerations

* Avoid sensitive personal data
* Email is displayed as contact info â€“ consider obfuscating it to prevent spam bots (e.g., using a contact form later)

## Development Phases or Milestones

1. **Set Up Replit Project**
2. **Build Static HTML Structure**
3. **Apply Responsive Styling (CSS/Framework)**
4. **Add Placeholder Content**
5. **Test on Desktop and Mobile Views**
6. **Replace Placeholders with Real Content**

## Potential Challenges and Solutions

* **Challenge**: Maintaining mobile responsiveness

  * **Solution**: Use a CSS framework or test frequently on different screen sizes

* **Challenge**: Spam through email display

  * **Solution**: Use email obfuscation or a contact form in the future

## Future Expansion Possibilities

* Add a downloadable resume PDF
* Include a contact form
* Add a blog or updates section
* Use a CMS or lightweight backend if dynamic content is needed later
